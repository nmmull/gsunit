# Gsunit

`Gsunit` is a library for building [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) autograders for [OCaml](https://ocaml.org).
It's built on top of [OUnit2](https://github.com/gildor478/ounit) and is currently (2025-08-19) in it's very early stages.
I created it specifically for *CAS CS 320: Concepts of Programming Languages*, but I attempted to make the library fairly general and extendible.
In particular, I've attempted to be as true as possible to the [autograder specification](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/) given by Gradescope.
